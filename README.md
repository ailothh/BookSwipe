# BookSwipe
BookSwipe is a Tinder-style book discovery app that helps users find books quickly based on vibe, not long descriptions.

Users swipe through books and decide within seconds whether a book interests them — no scrolling, no reviews, no decision fatigue.

🚀 Problem

Traditional book discovery platforms:

Require long descriptions

Depend heavily on reviews and ratings

Create friction and overwhelm

This makes discovering new books slow and exhausting.

💡 Solution

BookSwipe makes book discovery:

Fast

Visual

Intuitive

Engaging

Each book is presented as a single swipe card with a short, AI-generated summary that captures the book’s feel.

🎯 Core Idea

Help users discover books they’ll enjoy by understanding a book’s vibe, not its full plot.

The experience is designed to feel:

Quick

Lightweight

Addictive (in a good way)
